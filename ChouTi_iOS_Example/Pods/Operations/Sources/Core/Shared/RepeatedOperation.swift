/**
 Define a strategy for waiting a given time interval. The strategy
 can then create a NSTimeInterval generator. The strategies are:
 
 ### Fixed
 The fixed strategy is initialized with a time interval. Every
 interval is this value.
 - Requires: time interval must be greater than zero

 ### Random
 The random strategy is initialized with minimum and maximum
 bounds. These are both NSTimeInterval values. Each value from
 the generator is a random interval between these bounds.
 - requires: minimum time interval must be greater than or equal to zero
 - requires: maximum time interval must be greater than the minimum

 ### Incrementing
 The incrementing strategy is initialized with an starting or
 initial interval, and an increment value. Each value adds the
 increment to the previous value.
 - requires: initial time interval must be greater than or equal to zero.
 - notes: a decrementing strategy can be created with a large initial
    value and negative increments. The value will never be less than
    zero however.

 ### Exponential
 The exponential strategy is initialized with a time period, and
 a maximum value. Successive value of the generator multiply the
 period by an exponentially increasing factors, but not past the
 maximum.
 - requires: time period must be greater than or equal to zero
 - requires: maximum time interval must be greater than zero
 - requires: time period must be less than maxium
 ### Fibonacci
 Like the exponential strategy except the period is multipled by
 the Fibonacci numbers instead.
 - requires: time period must be greater than or equal to zero
 - requires: maximum time interval must be greater than zero
 - requires: time period must be less than maxium

/**

 ### RepeatedOperation

 RepeatedOperation is an GroupOperation subclass which can be used in
 conjunction with a GeneratorType to schedule NSOperation subclasses of
 the same type on a private queue.
 
 This is useful directly for periodically running idempotent operations,
 and it forms the basis for operations types which can be retried in the
 event of a failure.
 
 The operations may optionally be scheduled after a delay has passed, or
 a date in the future has been reached.
 
 At the lowest level, which offers the most flexibility, RepeatedOperation
 is initialized with a generator. The generator (something conforming to
 GeneratorType) element type is (Delay?, T), where T is a NSOperation
 subclass, and Delay is an enum used in conjunction with DelayOperation.
 
 For example:

 ```swift
 let operation = RepeatedOperation(anyGenerator { 
     return (.By(0.1), MyOperation())
 })
 ```

 The operation is a `GroupOperation` subclass which works by adding 
 new instances of the operation to its group. This happens initially 
 when the group starts, and then again when the child operation finishes.

 There are two ways to stop the operations from repeating.

 1. Return `nil` from the generator passed to the initializer
 2. Set the 1st argument, `maxCount` to a the number of times an 
     operation will be executed (i.e. it includes the initial 
     operation). The value defaults to .None which indicates repeating
     forever.

 Convenience initializers support the combination of a simple () -> T?
 block with standard wait strategies. See WaitStrategy for more information.

 For example, to use exponential back-off, with a maximum of 10 attempts:

 ```swift
 let operation = RepeatedOperation(maxCounts: 10,
     strategy: .Exponential((minimum: 1, maximum: 300)),
     anyGenerator {
         MyOperation()
     }
 )
 ```
 
 Note that in this case, the generator supplied only needs to return the
 operation instead of a tuple.

         strategy: .Random((0.1, 1.0)), 
         generator: MyOperationGenerator()
     )
